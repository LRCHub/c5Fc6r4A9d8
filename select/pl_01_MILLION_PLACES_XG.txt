Whoooh
I just touched down in A-town I spent
Last night in H-town and then
Woke up in New York City
What's it like in Paris lately?
Wide awake like the city never sleeps
One too many things I never seen
No place I'd rather be
Than being in the middle of your love
Dreamed a lot of things
Now we're right around
Different city names
That we can't pronounce
Still you held us down
No matter where we are we're
Looking for you everywhere we go
Reaching your hands when we on the road
All around the world all around the globe
We love you in a million ways, In a million
places
Touched by the shining lights
Hearing your voices in every line
Crossing every sea every borderline
We love you in a million ways, In a million
places
In a million places
In a million places
Oh
We love you in a million places
6pm I'm watching sunset in LA
Shooting tiktoks on top of golden gate
I pushed my way through the Brooklyn banks
I'm always switching sceneries so you know
I'll be on my way
I'm off to breaking boundaries
In each and every state, city, a place
Just to see the smile in your face (ha)
Word up, I had to pick up the slang
Hope I remember I'm still picking my brain
Dreamed a lot of things
Now we're right around
Different city names that we can't pronounce
Still you held us down
No matter where we are we're
Looking for you everywhere we go
Reaching your hands when we on the road
All around the world all around the globe
We love you in a million ways
In a million places
Touched by the shining lights
Hearing your voices in every line
Crossing every sea every borderline
We love in a million ways
In a million places
There's no place like home
I'm holding it close
I'm taking it with me
It's part of my soul
Just like the memories yeah
They stay with me yeah
They never leave yeah no
Looking for you everywhere we go
Reaching your hands when we on the road
All around the world all around the globe
We love you in a million ways
In a million places
Touched by the shining lights
Hearing your voices in every line
Crossing every sea every borderline
We love in a million ways
In a million places
In a million places
(See you around in a million places)
In a million places
(Thinking about you a million ways)
Oh oh oh oh oh
(See you around in a million places)
We love you in a million places
(Thinking about you a million ways)
Woo ah oh
(See you around in a million places)
(Thinking about you a million ways)
Woo ah oh
(See you around in a million places)
(Thinking about you a million ways)
See you in a million places
